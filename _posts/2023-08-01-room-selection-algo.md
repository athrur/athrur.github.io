# Introduction

What is the best way to decide who gets what bedroom in a house? Ask any two university students that question and their response will likely wildly differ. As my 4 flatmates and I signed the contract sealing us together for 12 months, we all knew the question was looming. Together, we came up with several approaches - all of which had some flaw. Pulling names out of a hat? Boring. First come first serve? Unfair. Paying more for preference? Inequitable. We didnâ€™t make any progress until I proposed a new solution: Letting our AI overlords decide for us.
