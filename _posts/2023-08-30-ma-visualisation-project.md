Checkout my interactive Mergers and Acquisitions geographical visualisation tool below! This was put together in just a few hours, alongside a group project I took part in on an insight week at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/). It is just a prototype, but I am planning on rewriting and updating the application with all the features implemented.

**Please note**: On mobile or small devices, for best experience please turn your device horizontally and <a href=".">refresh</a>. You are also recommended to use Google Chrome.
