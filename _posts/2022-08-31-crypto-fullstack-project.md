# Introduction
As part of A Level Computer Science, we were all required to do a coursework project, worth 20% of our total grade. The project could be on any topic, as long as it was related to Computer Science. I chose to do a project investigating the relationship between social media and crypto prices. Read on to find out more.

**Important Note:** This is part 2 of a 2 part article. [Part 1]({{site.url}}/2022-08-01-tweet-based-trading) focuses on the general ideas behind the project. Part 2 focuses on the implementation of the project. If you haven't read [part 1]({{site.url}}/2022-08-01-tweet-based-trading), I would recommend reading it first.
